# CNN

## Introduction

### Exploratory Data Analysis

* Questions about the data.

* Visualizing, transforming, and modeling

## Methodology

* CNN models to be built.
    + Using a pretrained convnet
    + etc.
* Propose a method for choosing the top 5 models in a variety of candidate models.
    + Sampling from the original dataset to get the performance in each candidate model.
    + Take the advantage of less consumption of time for experiencing the desired models.
* Verify this method is applicable.
    + Compare the performance of each model which using the whole dataset with which using the sampling one.

## Results

## Discussions

## Conclusions

* Including the application of our CNN models
